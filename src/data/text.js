        text: 'The "Maharashtra Drone Mission" (MDM) is a state-led initiative aimed at making Maharashtra a global leader in drone technology. This program brings together academic institutions, industries, government bodies, and youth to foster indigenous research, development, and commercialization of drones and related technologies. By establishing drone centers and developing an autonomous drone ecosystem, the mission supports both urban and rural needs, promotes job creation, and drives economic growth. Key focus areas include R&D projects, training, policy support, and nurturing innovation to ensure the state\'s self-reliance in this transformative technology.\nHuman-like intelligence in drones refers to the ability of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to mimic human decision-making, perception, and problem-solving abilities through advanced AI and machine learning. This intelligence allows drones to autonomously navigate complex environments, adapt to dynamic situations, recognize objects, and make real-time decisions without direct human intervention.\nThe importance of human-like intelligence in drones lies in their potential to transform industries by enhancing efficiency, safety, and precision. In fields like agriculture, logistics, surveillance, disaster response, and infrastructure inspection, intelligent drones can perform tasks faster and more accurately, reducing the need for manual oversight. This advancement enables drones to handle sophisticated missions, such as search and rescue, obstacle avoidance, or precision mapping, making them invaluable tools for both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, human-like intelligence empowers drones to operate more autonomously and effectively, revolutionizing their role across diverse sectors.',
