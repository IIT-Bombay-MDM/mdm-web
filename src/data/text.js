        title: "Maharashtra Drone Mission",
        text: 'The <b>"Maharashtra Drone Mission" (MDM)</b> is a state-led initiative aimed at making Maharashtra a global leader in drone technology. This program brings together academic institutions, industries, government bodies, and youth to foster indigenous research, development, and commercialization of drones and related technologies. By establishing drone centers and developing an autonomous drone ecosystem, the mission supports both urban and rural needs, promotes job creation, and drives economic growth. Key focus areas include R&D projects, training, policy support, and nurturing innovation to ensure the state\'s self-reliance in this transformative technology.\n<b>Human-like intelligence</b> in drones refers to the ability of <b>UAVs</b> (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to mimic human decision-making, perception, and problem-solving abilities through advanced AI and machine learning. This intelligence allows drones to autonomously navigate complex environments, adapt to dynamic situations, recognize objects, and make real-time decisions without direct human intervention.\nThe importance of human-like intelligence in drones lies in their potential to transform industries by enhancing efficiency, safety, and precision. In fields like agriculture, logistics, surveillance, disaster response, and infrastructure inspection, intelligent drones can perform tasks faster and more accurately, reducing the need for manual oversight. This advancement enables drones to handle sophisticated missions, such as search and rescue, obstacle avoidance, or precision mapping, making them invaluable tools for both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, human-like intelligence empowers drones to operate more autonomously and effectively, revolutionizing their role across diverse sectors.',

        text: "The <b>MDM</b> is a statewide drone program bringing together academic and research institutions, government, industries, and youth for development of Maharashtra through drone technology, with <b>IIT Bombay</b> serving as the <b>Headquarter (Nodal) drone centre</b>. This mission aims to develop a safe and reliable integrated ecosystem for drones with distributed autonomy, which can be used for both urban and rural areas. This drone ecosystem will be pivotal in advancing the technology and the industry, and most importantly smooth and efficient integration into our airspace and communities at large. An ecosystem is an environment with a collection of entities that are interconnected, interdependent and governed by some general rules, and a drone ecosystem is no different. As a matter of fact, it is an ecosystem that is evolving at breakneck speed and is constantly changing.\nTo enable the same, IIT Bombay intends to establish a <b>“Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Drone and Anti-Drone Technology”</b>, which will act as the Headquarter (Nodal) drone centre of MDM. Please note that, IIT Bombay is working on the official formation of this CoE with constitution of various decision-making committees. With this in mind, our main aim is to develop cutting edge and advanced technologies for solving some of the most critical and high-risk problems as well as high-impact projects by developing a drone ecosystem in Maharashtra. In turn, transformations significantly improve quality of life for all beings in a sustainable and eco-friendly way.",
